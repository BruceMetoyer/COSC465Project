1. Introduction What is the Case Study?
This project is a Music Discovery App that helps users find new songs based on their music
preferences. Users answer questions about their taste and the app suggests a few songs to
check if they match the user’s style. Based on what the user likes or dislikes the app creates
personalized playlists that adjust over time.

Uses of the App: Discover new music with personalized suggestions. Track your listening habits
(top songs, albums, and genres). Create and share playlists with friends. Join music
communities and discuss new releases or trends with other users.

What Problem Does It Solve?
Too much choice: It can be overwhelming to find new music on big platforms.
No social connection: Existing apps lack strong community features for sharing and discussing
music.
Old recommendations: Other apps don’t always update playlists as your taste changes. 

2. User Requirements:
User Accounts: Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords. Option to connect
accounts with Google or social media.
Music Recommendations: Users answer questions, and the app suggests songs. Users can like
or dislike songs to improve future suggestions. Playlists automatically update based on listening
history.

3.System Architecture (Diagram and Overview) Overview of the System:
This app will need several parts working together to provide recommendations, playlists, and
social features.

User Management System: Handles signing up, logging in, and managing user profiles. 
Music Recommendation System: Collects user activity and suggests songs and playlists using smart
algorithms that learn what users like and dislike.
Music Database: Stores all songs, artists, genres, and music details available in the app.
Social System: Manages feeds, messages, and group chats so users can share music and join
communities.
Analytics System: Tracks how much music users listen to and provides updates and stats like
top songs, favorite genres, and listening stats.

4. System requirements specification:
Response Time: The app should deliver music recommendations and playlist updates within 2 seconds

Scalability: Must support thousands of users with varied preferences and allow for expanding
music catalog and user communities.

Capacity: Should handle high concurrent access, especially during peak hours.

User Experience: The interface should be intuitive and engaging, ensuring easy navigation
between playlists, recommendations, and feeds.

Accessibility: Support for screen readers and other accessibility tools to ensure inclusivity.

Availability: 99.9% uptime, with minimal downtime for maintenance.
Backup and Recovery: Regular backups to prevent data loss, especially for user-generated
content like playlists and feeds.

Data Privacy: Encryption for personal and musical preference data, with secure login options.
User Authentication: Use of secure authentication mechanisms, possibly including multi-factor
authentication.

Modularity: Each component (recommendation engine, playlist management, social features)
should be modular to facilitate updates.
Documentation: Complete documentation for future developers.
